EasyEats is a personalized recipe app that suggests recipes based on the ingredients you have in your refrigerator. 

## What it Does
EasyEats allows the user to scan each item they have in the fridge and recommends the top recipes based on which ingredients you have to cook with. Easy Eats can identify which items you have through a object detection model by simply scanning the item with your camera. Furthermore, it gives you the top recommended recipes based on the the closest search to all of the scanned ingredients.

## How it Works
EasyEats uses a object detection model through ML5.js to detect different vegetables and recognize what they are. With this ingredient list, EasyEats retrieves recipe information through an API call using the list of ingredients. EasyEats then provides a list of top recipe recommendations based on the ingredients you provided.
